## 🚀 Day 2 of 90 Days of DevOps: From Waterfalls to Agility - Understanding the Evolution of SDLC Models

### 📌 What is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process that guides how software is planned, developed, tested, deployed, and maintained. It ensures that the software product is delivered with high quality, within budget, and on time.

SDLC acts as a blueprint for software development, promoting clarity, structure, and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle.

### ✅ Why is SDLC Important?

- Ensures a structured and methodical development approach  
- Helps avoid costly mistakes by planning  
- Improves collaboration between teams  
- Enhances product quality through defined testing and feedback loops  
- Facilitates better project management and resource allocation  

### 🧩 Phases of SDLC

**1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis**  
Stakeholders define what the software should do (functional and non-functional).  
_Goal: Define the scope and ensure clarity before development starts._

**2. System Design**  
Architecture, UI/UX, and tech stack decisions are made.  
_Goal: Translate business needs into a blueprint._

**3. Implementation**  
Developers write code per the design.  
_Goal: Convert design into a functional product._

**4. Testing**  
Verifies functionality, bugs, performance.  
_Goal: Ensure quality and reliability._

**5. Deployment**  
Live rollout of the software.  
_Goal: Make the product accessible to users._

**6. Maintenance and Support**  
Bug fixes, updates, and feedback management.  
_Goal: Keep the software relevant and functional._

### 🔁 SDLC Through the DevOps Lens

In DevOps, the SDLC is enhanced with:

- CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Delivery)  
- Automated testing  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
- Monitoring & feedback loops  

This enables faster, more reliable software delivery.

### 🧱 SDLC Models: Waterfall vs Agile

#### ⛲ Waterfall Model (Traditional)
A linear, rigid, step-by-step model.  
- Each phase must be completed before the next begins.  
- Difficult to make changes later.  

**Pros:**  
- Simple to understand  
- Clear stages and deliverables  
- Best for small, well-defined projects  

**Cons:**  
- Inflexible to changes  
- Late testing  
- Poor fit for dynamic environments  

#### 🌊 Why Agile Emerged
Waterfall couldn’t keep up with rapid feedback, iteration, or modern DevOps needs—thus Agile was born.

#### 🚀 Agile Model (Modern)
Agile is iterative, adaptive, and customer-focused.

**Agile Development Lifecycle Includes:**
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Execution
- Daily Standups
- Sprint Review & Demo
- Retrospective

**Pros:**
- Rapid feedback  
- High adaptability  
- Better collaboration  

**Cons:**
- Requires continuous client involvement  
- Harder to estimate time and cost  
- Risk of poor documentation  

### 🤝 Agile + DevOps = 🔥
Agile focuses on adaptability and delivery.  
DevOps adds automation, integration, and operations collaboration.

Together, they supercharge software delivery.

### 💡 Final Thoughts
Waterfall suits static projects. Agile thrives in dynamic, collaborative environments.  
In DevOps, Agile is a natural fit for speed, quality, and iteration.
